When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Because if we somehow lose our data from our local repository, we may have a backup repository in Github remote repository. And also it's better for the team work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It would be good to know which data do I want and which one I don't. And also that I won't want to mess up my work.
